# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Using data supplied by the ride share company PyBer, I created a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type and created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: 

- Rural cities have the least number of rides at 125 and drivers at 78, but have the highest average fare per ride at $34.36 and average fare per driver at $55.49. The driver to ride ratio is .62
- Suburban cities have the middle number of rides at 625 and drivers at 490, and have the middle average fare per ride at 30.97 and average fare per driver at $39.50. The driver to ride ratio is .78
- Urban cities have the highest number of rides at 1625 and drivers at 2405, but have the lowest average fare per ride at $24.52 and average fare per driver at $16.57. The driver to ride ratio is 1.48

## Summary: 
Based on the results:

1. The lower the driver to ride ratio the more money the company and the drivers make, but this is at the expense of customer service as less drivers and greater distances mean high fares.
2. The higher the driver to ride ratio the less money the company and drivers make. The customer get a great deal, because the drivers are readily available and travel distances are shorter resulting in low fares. The drivers suffer as there are less oppurtunities to make money.
3. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle with about a .75 - .85 driver to ride ratio. The customers get a good price and the drivers and company both make money. I would add 15 drivers to the Rural cities and lower the number of Urban drivers by 1100.
